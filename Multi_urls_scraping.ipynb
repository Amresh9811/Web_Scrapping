            "Abstract:Core-collapse supernovae (SNe), marking the deaths of massive stars, are among the most powerful explosions in the Universe, responsible, e.g., for a predominant synthesis of chemical elements in their host galaxies. The majority of massive stars are thought to be born in close binary systems. To date, putative binary companions to the progenitors of SNe may have been detected in only two cases, SNe 1993J and 2011dh. We report on the search for a companion of the progenitor of the Type Ic SN 1994I, long considered to have been the result of binary interaction. Twenty years after explosion, we used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the SN site in the ultraviolet (F275W and F336W bands), resulting in deep upper limits on the expected companion: F275W > 26.1 mag and F336W > 24.7 mag. These allows us to exclude the presence of a main sequence companion with a mass >~ 10 Msun. Through comparison with theoretical simulations of possible progenitor populations, we show that the upper limits to a companion detection exclude interacting binaries with semi-conservative (late Case A or early Case B) mass transfer. The limits tend to favor systems with non-conservative, late Case B mass transfer with intermediate initial orbital periods and mass ratios. The most likely mass range for a putative main sequence companion would be ~5--12 Msun, the upper end of which corresponds to the inferred upper detection limit.\n",

            "Abstract:Core-collapse supernovae (SNe), marking the deaths of massive stars, are among the most powerful explosions in the Universe, responsible, e.g., for a predominant synthesis of chemical elements in their host galaxies. The majority of massive stars are thought to be born in close binary systems. To date, putative binary companions to the progenitors of SNe may have been detected in only two cases, SNe 1993J and 2011dh. We report on the search for a companion of the progenitor of the Type Ic SN 1994I, long considered to have been the result of binary interaction. Twenty years after explosion, we used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the SN site in the ultraviolet (F275W and F336W bands), resulting in deep upper limits on the expected companion: F275W > 26.1 mag and F336W > 24.7 mag. These allows us to exclude the presence of a main sequence companion with a mass >~ 10 Msun. Through comparison with theoretical simulations of possible progenitor populations, we show that the upper limits to a companion detection exclude interacting binaries with semi-conservative (late Case A or early Case B) mass transfer. The limits tend to favor systems with non-conservative, late Case B mass transfer with intermediate initial orbital periods and mass ratios. The most likely mass range for a putative main sequence companion would be ~5--12 Msun, the upper end of which corresponds to the inferred upper detection limit.\n",

            "Abstract:Campana introduced a notion of Campana rational connectedness for Campana orbifolds. Given a Campana fibration over a complex curve, we prove that a version of weak approximation for Campana sections holds at places of good reduction when the general fiber satisfies a slightly stronger version of Campana rational connectedness. Campana also conjectured that any Fano orbifold is Campana rationally connected; we verify a stronger statement for toric Campana orbifolds. A key tool in our study is log geometry and moduli stacks of stable log maps.\n",

            "AbstractThis article addresses the relationship among hysteria, gaslighting, and gender during the SARS-CoV-2 (“Covid”) pandemic in the political and public-health messaging about Covid. Between early 2020 and January 2024, nearly 775 million cases of Covid have been documented worldwide, with a staggering death toll of almost 7 million. In the United States alone, 1.16 million people have died, and millions more continue to suffer the effects of the infection, with increased risk rates of cardiac problems, cognitive disorders, and autoimmune diseases. As a result of the Covid pandemic, at least 65 million people have been diagnosed with post-acute sequela of the virus (PACS), often termed “Long Covid.”  Some of those who were infected and recovered later develop cardiovascular, cognitive, and other major disorders related to that infection.The article analyzes the U.S. public health messaging in the age of Covid, explaining how individualism, gender, and gaslighting have shaped the public response to the virus and negatively affected public health. In explaining the poor U.S. public health outcomes during Covid, the article evaluates the role of disinformation about vaccines, the “feminization” of masking, and the “vax and relax” public mantra, which suggested that those who did not relax were perhaps a bit hysterical. Finally, the article considers how gaslighting occurs in the context of dismissing the potential long-term dangers of Covid infections and reinfections. There are numerous reasons the U.S. has fared poorly during Covid.  This article explores another reason that deserves investigation: The role of gender and its relationship with extreme individualism in healthcare messaging.\n",

In particular we show that compact complex manifolds of Kodaira dimension 0 having strongly semiample cotangent bundle are parallelizable manifolds, while compact complex manifolds of Kodaira dimension 0 having weakly semiample cotangent bundle are quotients of parallelizable manifolds. The main constructions used involve considerations about semiampleness of vector bundles, which are themselves of interest. As a byproduct we prove that compact manifolds having Kodaira dimension 0 and weakly sermiample cotangent bundle have infinite fundamental group, and we conjecture that this should be the case for all compact complex manifolds not of general type with weakly semiample cotangent bundle.'}\n",

The majority of massive stars are thought to be born in close binary systems. To date, putative binary companions to the progenitors of SNe may have been detected in only two cases, SNe 1993J and 2011dh. We report on the search for a companion of the progenitor of the Type Ic SN 1994I, long considered to have been the result of binary interaction. Twenty years after explosion, we used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the SN site in the ultraviolet (F275W and F336W bands), resulting in deep upper limits on the expected companion: F275W > 26.1 mag and F336W > 24.7 mag. These allows us to exclude the presence of a main sequence companion with a mass >~ 10 Msun. Through comparison with theoretical simulations of possible progenitor populations, we show that the upper limits to a companion detection exclude interacting binaries with semi-conservative (late Case A or early Case B) mass transfer. The limits tend to favor systems with non-conservative, late Case B mass transfer with intermediate initial orbital periods and mass ratios. The most likely mass range for a putative main sequence companion would be ~5--12 Msun, the upper end of which corresponds to the inferred upper detection limit.'}\n",

The whole slide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide image enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to computational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are utilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data. Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity automatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity evaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The proposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of six fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This method outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for artifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the evaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the system was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical usability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.'}\n",

More specifically, asset prices are more sensitive to the systematic economic news that impose a pervasive effect on the whole market. Moreover, the investors will not be rewarded for bearing idiosyncratic risks as such risks are diversifiable. In the paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an attribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces influencing the market. They first defined and examined five classic factors from previous research papers: Industrial Production, Unanticipated Inflation, Change in Expected Inflation, Risk Premia, and The Term Structure. By adding in new factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they examined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The paper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic news, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the significant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by such motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general framework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic factors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.'}\n",

Starting from the interaction-only limit, which can be solved exactly, we analyze the transport and thermodynamic behavior as a function of filling and temperature at the leading non-trivial order in the single-particle hopping. Over a broad range of intermediate temperatures, we find evidence of a dc resistivity scaling linearly with temperature and with typical values far exceeding the quantum of resistance, $h/e^2$. At a sequence of commensurate fillings, the bad-metallic regime eventually crosses over into interaction induced insulating phases in the limit of low temperatures.

In the present work, we provide a complete list of magnetic space groups which can host symmetry-protected nodal-point/line band structures for spin-1/2 fermionic particles, where the degeneracies at the nodal points/lines are guaranteed by irreducible projective representations (IPReps) of the little co-groups.

Their fundamental inconsistencies render a consistent theory of quantum gravity the most challenging problem in physics. Here we propose an information-complete quantum field theory (ICQFT), which describes elementary fermions, their gauge fields, and gravity (together, called the trinary fields) as an elementary trinity without any conceptual inconsistency of existing theories. We then argue that the ICQFT provides a coherent picture and conceptual framework of unifying matter and spacetime (gravity) as information via spacetime-matter entanglement and gives a compelling solution to the problem of time and time's arrow. The trinary fields are characterized by dual entanglement and dual dynamics. Spacetime-matter entanglement encodes complete physical predictions of the theory and allows us to give a quantum information definition of dark energy. We consider two particular forms of spacetime-matter entangled states and their physical consequences. One of them\\\\ is consistent with the variational holographic relation and another results in an universal relation between entanglement entropy and geometry (area and volume). This latter relation allows us to determine the cosmological constant term in the classical Einstein equation and implies that our Universe is not strictly holographic due to dark energy (related to an universal negative pressure). We predict the interior quantum state of a Schwarzschild black hole to be maximally information-complete. As a concrete quantum formulation of gravity coupled with matter, the ICQFT is about quantum information dynamics for spacetime and matter and eliminates the conceptual obstacles of existing quantum gravity theory.\"}\n",

Several mathematical approaches have been proposed to model the coupling of both processes, where one of the most successful methods relies on a phase field that encodes the morphology of the cell, together with the integration of partial differential equations that account for the polarization mechanism inside the cell domain as defined by the phase field. This approach has been previously employed to model the motion of single cells of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a widely used model organism to study actin-driven motility and chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells. Besides single cell motility, Dictyostelium discoideum is also well-known for its collective behavior. Here, we extend the previously introduced model for single cell motility to describe the collective motion of large populations of interacting amoebae by including repulsive interactions between the cells. We performed numerical simulations of this model, first characterizing the motion of single cells in terms of their polarity and velocity vectors. We then systematically studied the collisions between two cells that provided the basic interaction scenarios also observed in larger ensembles of interacting amoebae. Finally, the relevance of the cell density was analyzed, revealing a systematic decrease of the motility with density, associated with the formation of transient cell clusters that emerge in this system. This model is a prototypical active matter system for the investigation of the emergent collective dynamics of deformable, self-driven cells with a highly complex, nonlinear coupling of cell shape deformations, self-propulsion and repulsive cell-cell interactions.'}\n",

The waves exhibit density excursions that substantially exceed the equilibrium plasma density. Remarkably, these extremely nonlinear waves persist even when the small amplitude drives are turned off. We derive the weakly nonlinear analytical theory by applying Whitham\\'s averaged variational principle to the Lagrangian formulation of the fluid equations. The resulting system of coupled weakly nonlinear equations is shown to be in good agreement with fully nonlinear simulations of the warm fluid model. The analytical conditions and thresholds required for autoresonant excitation to occur are derived and compared to simulations. The weakly nonlinear theory guides and informs numerical study of how the two-phase quasicrystalline structure \"melts\" into a single phase traveling wave when one drive is below a threshold. These nonlinear structures may have applications to plasma photonics for extremely intense laser pulses, which are limited by the smallness of density perturbations of linear waves.'}\n",

We devise a new geometric approach to sharp fixed-time $L^p$-bounds with loss of derivatives for the wave equation driven by $\\\\mathcal{L}$, based on microlocal analysis and highlighting the role of the underlying sub-Riemannian geodesic flow. A major challenge here stems from the fact that, differently from the Riemannian case, the conjugate locus of a point on a sub-Riemannian manifold may cluster at the point itself, thus making it indispensable to deal with caustics even when studying small-time wave propagation.\\nOur analysis of the wave propagator on a $2$-step Carnot group allows us to reduce microlocally to two conic regions in frequency space: an anti-FIO region, which seems not amenable to FIO techniques, and an FIO region. For the latter, we construct a parametrix by means of FIOs with complex phase, by adapting a construction from the elliptic setting due to Laptev, Safarov and Vassiliev, which remains valid beyond caustics. A substantial problem arising here is that, after a natural decomposition and scalings, one must deal with the long-time behaviour and control of $L^1$-norms of the corresponding contributions to the wave propagator, a new phenomenon that is specific to sub-elliptic settings.\\nFor the class of Métivier groups, we show how our approach, in combination with a variation of the key method of Seeger, Sogge and Stein for proving $L^p$-estimates for FIOs, yields $L^p$-bounds for the wave equation, which are sharp up to the endpoint regularity. In particular, we extend previously known results for distinguished sub-Laplacians on groups of Heisenberg type, by means of a more general and robust approach.

We prove the existence and uniqueness of the generalized Young measure solutions. In addition, for the gradient flow of convex parabolic variational integral, we show that the generalized Young measure solutions are equivalent to the strong solutions.'}\n",

The proof is based on pointwise sparse domination of the adjoint singular integrals that map functions from the half-space back to the boundary. It is proved that these map $L_1$ functions in the half-space to weak $L_1$ functions on the boundary. From this a non-standard sparse domination of the singular integrals is established, where averages have been replaced by Carleson averages.'}\n",

The main result shows that, when $B \\\\subset A$ is C*-irreducible in the sense of Rørdam, and is centrally $\\\\Gamma$-free in the sense of the author, then after tensoring with the Cuntz algebra $\\\\mathcal{O}_2$, all intermediate C*-algebras $B \\\\subset C\\\\subset A \\\\rtimes_{\\\\rm r} \\\\Gamma$ enjoy a natural crossed product splitting \\\\[\\\\mathcal{O}_2\\\\otimes C=(\\\\mathcal{O}_2 \\\\otimes D) \\\\rtimes_{{\\\\rm r}, \\\\gamma, \\\\mathfrak{w}} \\\\Lambda\\\\] for $D:= C \\\\cap A$, some $\\\\Lambda<\\\\Gamma$, and a subsystem $(\\\\gamma, \\\\mathfrak{w})$ of a unitary perturbed cocycle action $\\\\Lambda \\\\curvearrowright \\\\mathcal{O}_2\\\\otimes A$. As an application, we give a new Galois's type theorem for the Bisch--Haagerup type inclusions \\\\[A^K \\\\subset A\\\\rtimes_{\\\\rm r} \\\\Gamma\\\\] for actions of compact-by-discrete groups $K \\\\rtimes \\\\Gamma$ on simple C*-algebras.\\nDue to a K-theoretical obstruction, the operation $\\\\mathcal{O}_2\\\\otimes -$ is necessary to obtain the clean splitting. Also, in general 2-cocycles $\\\\mathfrak{w}$ appearing in the splitting cannot be removed even further tensoring with any unital (cocycle) action. We show them by examples, which further show that $\\\\mathcal{O}_2$ is a minimal possible choice.\\nWe also establish a von Neumann algebra analogue, where $\\\\mathcal{O}_2$ is replaced by the type I factor $\\\\mathbb{B}(\\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb{N}))$.\"}\n",
