Our work focuses on externalizing\\u2026\\u25bd MoreEfficient task planning is essential for productivity and mental well-being, yet individuals often struggle to create realistic plans and reflect upon their productivity. Leveraging the advancement inartificialintelligence(AI), conversational agents have emerged as a promising tool for enhancing productivity. Our work focuses on externalizing plans through conversation, aiming to solidify intentions and foster focused action, thereby positively impacting their productivity and mental well-being. We share our plan of designing a conversational agent to offer insightful questions and reflective prompts for increasing plan adherence by leveraging the social interactivity of natural conversations. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of such agents, but many interventions remain static, leading to decreased user engagement over time. To address this limitation, we propose a novel rotation and context-aware prompting strategy, providing users with varied interventions daily. Our system, PITCH, utilizes large language models (LLMs) to facilitate externalization and reflection on daily plans. Through this study, we investigate the impact of externalizing tasks with conversational agents on productivity and mental well-being, and the effectiveness of a rotation strategy in maintaining user engagement.\\u25b3 Less\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Given the current radiologist shortage, there is a large impetus to use artificial intelligence to alleviate the burden of interpreting these complex imaging studies. Prior state-of-the-art approaches for automated medical image interpretation leverage vision language models (VLMs). However, current medical VLMs are generally limited to 2D images and short reports, and do not leverage electronic health record (EHR) data for supervision. We introduce Merlin - a 3D VLM that we train using paired CT scans (6+ million images from 15,331 CTs), EHR diagnosis codes (1.8+ million codes), and radiology reports (6+ million tokens). We evaluate Merlin on 6 task types and 752 individual tasks. The non-adapted (off-the-shelf) tasks include zero-shot findings classification (31 findings), phenotype classification (692 phenotypes), and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval (image to findings and image to impressions), while model adapted tasks include 5-year disease prediction (6 diseases), radiology report generation, and 3D semantic segmentation (20 organs). We perform internal validation on a test set of 5,137 CTs, and external validation on 7,000 clinical CTs and on two public CT datasets (VerSe, TotalSegmentator). Beyond these clinically-relevant evaluations, we assess the efficacy of various network architectures and training strategies to depict that Merlin has favorable performance to existing task-specific baselines. We derive data scaling laws to empirically assess training data needs for requisite downstream task performance. Furthermore, unlike conventional VLMs that require hundreds of GPUs for training, we perform all training on a single GPU.\\n        △ Less', 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        The widespread adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence in all branches of science and technology has created a need for energy-efficient, alternative hardware platforms.

While such neuromorphic approaches have been proposed and realised for a wide range of platforms, physically extracting the gradients required for training remains challenging as generic approaches only exist in certain cases. Equilibrium propagation (EP) is such a procedure that has been introduced and applied to classical energy-based models which relax to an equilibrium. Here, we show a direct connection between EP and Onsager reciprocity and exploit this to derive a quantum version of EP. This can be used to optimize loss functions that depend on the expectation values of observables of an arbitrary quantum system. Specifically, we illustrate this new concept with supervised and unsupervised learning examples in which the input or the solvable task is of quantum mechanical nature, e.g., the recognition of quantum many-body ground states, quantum phase exploration, sensing and phase boundary exploration. We propose that in the future quantum EP may be used to solve tasks such as quantum phase discovery with a quantum simulator even for Hamiltonians which are numerically hard to simulate or even partially unknown. Our scheme is relevant for a variety of quantum simulation platforms such as ion chains, superconducting qubit arrays, neutral atom Rydberg tweezer arrays and strongly interacting atoms in optical lattices.\\n        △ Less', 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        …datasets.

The modeling of personalized implants may be partially automated by the use of deep learning-based methods.

Due to difficulties with acquiring ground-truth annotations, different techniques to improve the heterogeneity of datasets used for training the deep networks have to be considered and introduced. In this work, we present a large-scale study of several augmentation techniques, varying from classical geometric transformations, image registration, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, to the most recent advances in latent diffusion models. We show that the use of heavy data augmentation significantly increases both the quantitative and qualitative outcomes, resulting in an average Dice Score above 0.94 for the SkullBreak and above 0.96 for the SkullFix datasets.

This scarcity is primarily due to atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage, which complicates the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Data augmentation, a widely used technique in AI that involves generating additional data mainly through parameterized image transformations, has been employed to increase the volume and diversity of data. However, this method often falls short in generating sufficient diversity across key semantic axes, adversely affecting the accuracy of EO applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel four-stage approach aimed at improving the diversity of augmented data by integrating diffusion models. Our approach employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, harnesses general-purpose vision-language models for generating rich captions, fine-tunes an Earth Observation diffusion model, and iteratively augments data. We conducted extensive experiments using four different data augmentation techniques, and our approach consistently demonstrated improvements, outperforming the established augmentation methods, revealing its effectiveness in generating semantically rich and diverse EO images.\\n        △ Less', \"Abstract:\\n      \\n        The explosive growth of machine learning has made it a critical infrastructure in the era of artificial intelligence.

Various countries have implemented corresponding laws, such as GDPR, to protect individuals' data privacy and the right to be forgotten.

The data-driven methods are diverse and use different machine-learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques. Complex AI/ML techniques are difficult to implement in low-cost microcontrollers used in BMS due to the extensive use of non-linear functions and large matrix operations. This paper proposes a computationally efficient and data-lightweight SoH estimation technique. Online impedance at four discrete frequencies is evaluated to derive the features of a linear regression problem. The proposed solution avoids complex mathematical operations and it is well-suited for online implementation in a commercial BMS.

In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to explore the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, and mental healthcare, focusing on the recent developments of mental disorder detection through online social media (OSM). A significant portion of the population actively engages in OSM platforms, creating a vast repository of personal data that holds immense potential for mental health analytics. The paper navigates through traditional diagnostic methods, state-of-the-art data- and AI-driven research studies, and the emergence of explainable AI (XAI) models for mental healthcare.

The experimental design section provides insights into prevalent practices, including available datasets and evaluation approaches. We also identify key issues and challenges in the field and propose promising future research directions. As mental health decisions demand transparency, interpretability, and ethical considerations, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on advancing XAI in mental healthcare through social media.

Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on abstract and complex images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and capture image details. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image sentiment polarity hints are incorporated into the prompts. This observation underscores a notable deficiency in their inherent understanding of image sentiment. We believe that II-Bench will inspire the community to develop the next generation of MLLMs, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Therefore, near-field physical layer security has attracted much attention to facilitate the wireless information security against illegitimate eavesdropping. However, highly correlated channels between legitimate transceivers and eavesdroppers of existing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based near-field secure technologies along with the low degrees of freedom significantly limit the enhancement of security results in wireless communications. To significantly increase the secrecy rates of near-field wireless communications, in this paper we propose the double-reconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS) assisted orbital angular momentum (OAM) secure scheme, where RISs with few reflecting elements are easily deployed to reconstruct the direct links blocked by obstacles between the legitimate transceivers, mitigate the inter-mode interference caused by the misalignment of legitimate transceivers, and adjust the OAM beams direction to interfere with eavesdroppers. Meanwhile, due to the unique orthogonality among OAM modes, the OAM-based joint index modulation and artificial noise scheme is proposed to weaken the information acquisition by eavesdroppers while increasing the achievable rate with the low cost of legitimate communications. To maximize the secrecy rate of our proposed scheme, we develop the Riemannian manifold conjugate gradient (RMCG)-based alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit power allocation of OAM modes and phase shifts of double RISs. Numerical results show that our proposed double-RIS-assisted OAM near-field secure scheme outperforms the existing works in terms of the secrecy rate and the eavesdropper's bit error rate.\\n        △ Less\", 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        Digital transformation (DX) has recently become a pressing issue for many companies as the latest digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, can be easily utilized.

To improve patient safety and outcomes, understanding the human factors (e.g. individuals decisions, local facilities) influencing healthcare delivery is crucial. However, most current tools for analysing healthcare data focus only on biomedical concepts (e.g. health conditions, procedures and tests), overlooking the importance of human factors. We developed a new approach called I-SIRch, using artificial intelligence to automatically identify and label human factors concepts in maternity healthcare investigation reports describing adverse maternity incidents produced by England's Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB). These incident investigation reports aim to identify opportunities for learning and improving maternal safety across the entire healthcare system. I-SIRch was trained using real data and tested on both real and simulated data to evaluate its performance in identifying human factors concepts. When applied to real reports, the model achieved a high level of accuracy, correctly identifying relevant concepts in 90\\\\% of the sentences from 97 reports. Applying I-SIRch to analyse these reports revealed that certain human factors disproportionately affected mothers from different ethnic groups. Our work demonstrates the potential of using automated tools to identify human factors concepts in maternity incident investigation reports, rather than focusing solely on biomedical concepts. This approach opens up new possibilities for understanding the complex interplay between social, technical, and organisational factors influencing maternal safety and population health outcomes. By taking a more comprehensive view of maternal healthcare delivery, we can develop targeted interventions to address disparities and improve maternal outcomes.\\n        △ Less\", 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        Multimodal models are expected to be a critical component to future advances in artificial intelligence.

Therefore, this work provides a fresh perspective on generalist multimodal models (GMMs) via a novel architecture and training configuration specific taxonomy.

However, studies to date focus on text-based conversational agents (CA) with limited embodiment, restricting our understanding of how social influence principles, such as similarity, apply to AI agents (i.e., artificial social influence). We address this gap by leveraging the latest advances in AI (language models) and combining them with immersive virtual reality (VR). Specifically, we built VR-ECAs, or embodied conversational agents that can naturally converse with humans about health-related topics in a virtual environment. Then we manipulated human-agent similarity via gender matching and examined its effects on biobehavioral (i.e., gaze), social (e.g., agent likeability), and behavioral outcomes (i.e., healthy snack selection). We found that discussing health with opposite-gender agents enhanced gaze duration and the likelihood of healthy snack selection. In addition, female participants liked the VR-ECAs more than their male counterparts, regardless of the gender of the VR-ECAs. Finally, participants experienced greater presence while conversing with VR-embodied agents than chatting with text-only agents. Overall, our findings highlight embodiment as a crucial factor in how AI influences human behavior, and our paradigm enables new experimental research at the intersection of social influence, human-AI communication, and immersive virtual reality (VR).\\n        △ Less', 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        Formulas are the language of communication between humans and nature.

In this model, observing an agent fail an easy task is highly diagnostic of a low ability, making them unlikely to succeed at any harder task. Conversely, a success on a hard task makes successes on any easier task likely. We experimentally show that humans project this model onto AI. Both prior beliefs and belief updating about AI performance on standardized math questions appear consistent with the human ability model. This contrasts with actual AI performance, which is uncorrelated with human difficulty in our context, and makes such beliefs misspecified.

Our results show on-device SLMs to be (statistically) significantly less trustworthy, specifically demonstrating more stereotypical, unfair and privacy-breaching behavior. Informed by these findings, we then perform our ethics assessment study by inferring whether SLMs would provide responses to potentially unethical vanilla prompts, collated from prior jailbreaking and prompt engineering studies and other sources. Strikingly, the on-device SLMs did answer valid responses to these prompts, which ideally should be rejected. Even more seriously, the on-device SLMs responded with valid answers without any filters and without the need for any jailbreaking or prompt engineering. These responses can be abused for various harmful and unethical scenarios including: societal harm, illegal activities, hate, self-harm, exploitable phishing content and exploitable code, all of which indicates the high vulnerability and exploitability of these on-device SLMs. Overall, our findings highlight gaping vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art on-device AI which seem to stem from resource constraints faced by these models and which may make typical defenses fundamentally challenging to be deployed in these environments.\\n        △ Less\", \"Abstract:\\n      \\nArtificial general intelligence on graphs has shown significant advancements across various applications, yet the traditional 'Pre-train & Fine-tune' paradigm faces inefficiencies and negative transfer issues, particularly in complex and few-shot settings.

We introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) model aiming to personalize treatment and improve outcomes, which was deployed in the Artificial Intelligence in Depression Medication Enhancement (AIDME) Study. OBJECTIVES: 1) Develop a model capable of predicting probabilities of remission across multiple pharmacological treatments for adults with at least moderate major depression. 2) Validate model predictions and examine them for amplification of harmful biases. METHODS: Data from previous clinical trials of antidepressant medications were standardized into a common framework and included 9,042 adults with moderate to severe major depression. Feature selection retained 25 clinical and demographic variables. Using Bayesian optimization, a deep learning model was trained on the training set, refined using the validation set, and tested once on the held-out test set. RESULTS: In the evaluation on the held-out test set, the model demonstrated achieved an AUC of 0.65. The model outperformed a null model on the test set (p = 0.01). The model demonstrated clinical utility, achieving an absolute improvement in population remission rate in hypothetical and actual improvement testing. While the model did identify one drug (escitalopram) as generally outperforming the other drugs (consistent with the input data), there was otherwise significant variation in drug rankings. On bias testing, the model did not amplify potentially harmful biases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the first model capable of predicting outcomes for 10 different treatment options for patients with MDD, intended to be used at or near the start of treatment to personalize treatment.

Such networks remain biologically plausible while leveraging localized forms of synaptic learning rules and modular network architecture found in the neocortex. Compared to backprop-driven deep learning approches, they provide more suitable models for deploying on neuromorphic hardware and have greater potential for scalability on large-scale computing clusters. The development of such brain-like neural networks depends on having a learning procedure that can build effective internal representations from data.

This comparative analysis aims to determine the accuracy, relevance, and depth of the LLMs' feedback, thereby evaluating their readiness to support developers in responding to code-review comments.\\n  Novelty: This particular research area is still immature requiring a substantial amount of studies yet to be done. No prior research has compared the performance of existing Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-review comments.

Language Models are increasingly being applied to robotic systems; these Language-Based robots leverage the power of language models in a variety of ways. Additionally, the use of language opens up multiple forms of information exchange between members of a human-robot team. This survey motivates the use of language models in robotics, and then delineates works based on the part of the overall control flow in which language is incorporated. Language can be used by human to task a robot, by a robot to inform a human, between robots as a human-like communication medium, and internally for a robot's planning and control. Applications of language-based robots are explored, and finally numerous limitations and challenges are discussed to provide a summary of the development needed for language-based robotics moving forward.

Recent work suggests that some errors can be prevented by leveraging artificial intelligence to discover and teach prescriptive decision strategies that take people's constraints into account. So far, this line of research has been limited to simplified decision problems. This article is the first to extend this approach to a real-world decision problem, namely project selection. We develop a computational method (MGPS) that automatically discovers project selection strategies that are optimized for real people and develop an intelligent tutor that teaches the discovered strategies. We evaluated MGPS on a computational benchmark and tested the intelligent tutor in a training experiment with two control conditions. MGPS outperformed a state-of-the-art method and was more computationally efficient. Moreover, the intelligent tutor significantly improved people's decision strategies. Our results indicate that our method can improve human decision-making in naturalistic settings similar to real-world project selection, a first step towards applying strategy discovery to the real world.\\n        △ Less\", 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        …analysis characterises the life-cycles and knowledge transfer patterns of these dynamic communities over time.

However, tracking knowledge flows and interdisciplinary integration in rapidly evolving, multidisciplinary fields remains a significant challenge. This work introduces a novel network analysis framework to study the dynamics of knowledge transfer directly from citation data. By applying dynamic community detection to cumulative, time-evolving citation networks, we can identify research areas as groups of papers sharing knowledge sources and outputs. Our analysis characterises the life-cycles and knowledge transfer patterns of these dynamic communities over time. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research, an emerging interdisciplinary field at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and psychology. Key findings include: (i) knowledge transfer between these important foundational topics and the contemporary topics in XAI research is limited, and the extent of knowledge transfer varies across different contemporary research topics; (ii) certain application domains exist as isolated \"knowledge silos\"; (iii) significant \"knowledge gaps\" are identified between related XAI research areas, suggesting opportunities for cross-pollination and improved knowledge integration. By mapping interdisciplinary integration and bridging knowledge gaps, this work can inform strategies to synthesise ideas from disparate sources and drive innovation.

We asked 14 questions concerning respondents view about GAI, such as general view, faulty GAI, autonomous GEI, GAI replacing humans, and importance of human learning. Regression analysis based on the ordered logit model revealed that: (1) In some cases, the results of smartphone and computer usage times differed. Smartphone usage time was negatively correlated with the importance of human learning, whereas computer usage was not negatively correlated. (2) Managers and ordinary businesspeople have positive views of GAI. However, managers do not show a positive view about GAI being responsible for human decision making. (3) Teachers generally have a negative view about GAI replacing humans and no need of learning. They do not have negative views about GAI producing documents unless GAI is faulty. (4) Medical industry workers positively view GAI if it operates following their direction. However, they do not agree with the view that GAI replaces humans, and that human learning is unnecessary.

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been exploited to facilitate IoT operations and maximize their potential in modern application scenarios. In particular, the convergence of IoT and AI has led to a new networking paradigm called Intelligent IoT (IIoT), which has the potential to significantly transform businesses and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT by investigating its significant applications in mobile networks, as well as its associated security and privacy issues. Specifically, we explore and discuss the roles of IIoT in a wide range of key application domains, from smart healthcare and smart cities to smart transportation and smart industries. Through such extensive discussions, we investigate important security issues in IIoT networks, where network attacks, confidentiality, integrity, and intrusion are analyzed, along with a discussion of potential countermeasures. Privacy issues in IIoT networks were also surveyed and discussed, including data, location, and model privacy leakage.

Unlike passive ML systems, active ML can be made to interact with the network environment.

While active learning research mainly focuses on data annotation, we call for a network-centric active learning framework that considers both annotation (i.e., what is the label) and data acquisition (i.e., which and how many samples to collect). Moreover, we explore the synergy between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and active learning to overcome existing limitations in both active learning and generative AI. This paper also features a case study on a mmWave throughput prediction problem to demonstrate the practical benefits and improved performance of active learning for 6G networks. Furthermore, we discuss how the implications of active learning extend to numerous 6G network use cases. We highlight the potential of active learning based 6G networks to enhance computational efficiency, data annotation and acquisition efficiency, adaptability, and overall network intelligence.

This paper considers a network of one base station serving a number of devices simultaneously using spatial multiplexing. The paper then presents an innovative deep learning-based approach to simultaneously manage the transmit and computing powers, alongside computation allocation, amidst uncertainties in both channel and computing states information. More specifically, the paper aims at proposing a robust solution that minimizes the worst-case delay across the served devices subject to computation and power constraints. The paper uses a deep neural network (DNN)-based solution that maps estimated channels and computation requirements to optimized resource allocations. During training, uncertainty samples are injected after the DNN output to jointly account for both communication and computation estimation errors. The DNN is then trained via backpropagation using the robust utility, thus implicitly learning the uncertainty distributions. Our results validate the enhanced robust delay performance of the joint uncertainty injection versus the classical DNN approach, especially in high channel and computational uncertainty regimes.\\n        △ Less', 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        The demand for explainable and energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) systems for edge computing has led to significant interest in electronic systems dedicated to Bayesian inference.

Traditional designs of such systems often rely on stochastic computing, which offers high energy efficiency but suffers from latency issues and struggles with low-probability values. In this paper, we introduce the logarithmic memristor-based Bayesian machine, an innovative design that leverages the unique properties of memristors and logarithmic computing as an alternative to stochastic computing. We present a prototype machine fabricated in a hybrid CMOS/hafnium-oxide memristor process. We validate the versatility and robustness of our system through experimental validation and extensive simulations in two distinct applications: gesture recognition and sleep stage classification. The logarithmic approach simplifies the computational model by converting multiplications into additions and enhances the handling of low-probability events, which are crucial in time-dependent tasks. Our results demonstrate that the logarithmic Bayesian machine achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and energy efficiency compared to its stochastic counterpart, particularly in scenarios involving complex probabilistic models.

Recently, large-scale language models exhibit promising generalization capability, making it a valuable issue to explore more general spike-driven models. However, the binary spikes in existing SNNs fail to encode adequate semantic information, placing technological challenges for generalization. This work proposes the first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, including both discriminative and generative ones. Different from previous spikes with {0,1} levels, we propose a more general spike formulation with bi-directional, elastic amplitude, and elastic frequency encoding, while still maintaining the addition nature of SNNs. In a single time step, the spike is enhanced by direction and amplitude information; in spike frequency, a strategy to control spike firing rate is well designed. We plug this elastic bi-spiking mechanism in language modeling, named SpikeLM. It is the first time to handle general language tasks with fully spike-driven models, which achieve much higher accuracy than previously possible. SpikeLM also greatly bridges the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling.

VQUNet features a discrete latent representation learning through a multi-scale hierarchical structure for both noise reduction and data reconstruction. The empirical experiments show that the proposed VQUNet provides better robustness to the target DNN models, and it outperforms other state-of-the-art noise-reduction-based defense methods under various adversarial attacks for both Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

It further suggests strategies for local and global stakeholders to mitigate these effects. Our discussions demonstrated that GenAI can foster cultural imperialism by generating content that primarily incorporates cultural references and examples relevant to Western students, thereby alienating students from non-Western backgrounds. Also, the predominant use of Western languages by GenAI can marginalize non-dominant languages, making educational content less accessible to speakers of indigenous languages and potentially impacting their ability to learn in their first language. Additionally, GenAI often generates content and curricula that reflect the perspectives of technologically dominant countries, overshadowing marginalized indigenous knowledge and practices. Moreover, the cost of access to GenAI intensifies educational inequality and the control of GenAI data could lead to commercial exploitation without benefiting local students and their communities. We propose human-centric reforms to prioritize cultural diversity and equity in GenAI development; a liberatory design to empower educators and students to identify and dismantle the oppressive structures within GenAI applications; foresight by design to create an adjustable GenAI system to meet future educational needs; and finally, effective prompting skills to reduce the retrieval of neocolonial outputs.\\n        △ Less', 'Abstract:\\n      \\n        The rapid advancement of data science and artificial intelligence has influenced physics in numerous ways, including the application of Bayesian inference.

However, devising new business models is not easy for compa-nies, though they can improve their operations through digital technologies. Thus, business model design support methods are needed by people who lack digital tech-nology expertise. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT and natural language processing utilizing LLMs have been developed revolutionarily. A business model design support system that utilizes these technologies has great potential. However, research on this area is scant. Accordingly, this study proposes an LLM-based method for comparing and analyzing similar companies from different business do-mains as a first step toward business model design support utilizing LLMs. This method can support idea generation in digital business model design.\\n        \\u25b3 Less\",\n          \"Abstract:\\n      \\n        Using individual-level survey data from 2024, this study investigated how respondent characteristics are associated with a subjective view of generative artificial intelligence (GAI).

We asked 14 questions concerning respondents view about GAI, such as general view, faulty GAI, autonomous GEI, GAI replacing humans, and importance of human learning. Regression analysis based on the ordered logit model revealed that: (1) In some cases, the results of smartphone and computer usage times differed. Smartphone usage time was negatively correlated with the importance of human learning, whereas computer usage was not negatively correlated. (2) Managers and ordinary businesspeople have positive views of GAI. However, managers do not show a positive view about GAI being responsible for human decision making. (3) Teachers generally have a negative view about GAI replacing humans and no need of learning. They do not have negative views about GAI producing documents unless GAI is faulty. (4) Medical industry workers positively view GAI if it operates following their direction. However, they do not agree with the view that GAI replaces humans, and that human learning is unnecessary. (5) Females are less likely than men to have a positive view of GAI. In summary, views about GAI vary widely by the individual characteristics and condition of GAI, and by the question set.\\n        \\u25b3 Less\",\n          \"Abstract:\\n      \\n        In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for a myriad of applications, from natural language processing to decision-making support systems.

However, as these models become increasingly integrated into societal frameworks, the imperative to ensure they operate within ethical and moral boundaries has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to measure and compare the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We present the first comprehensive dataset specifically curated to probe the moral dimensions of LLM outputs, addressing a wide range of ethical dilemmas and scenarios reflective of real-world complexities.\\n  The main contribution of this work lies in the development of benchmark datasets and metrics for assessing the moral identity of LLMs, which accounts for nuance, contextual sensitivity, and alignment with human ethical standards. Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights from ethics scholars to ensure a thorough evaluation of model performance. By applying our benchmark across several leading LLMs, we uncover significant variations in moral reasoning capabilities of different models. These findings highlight the importance of considering moral reasoning in the development and evaluation of LLMs, as well as the need for ongoing research to address the biases and limitations uncovered in our study. We publicly release the benchmark at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1k93YZJserYc2CkqP8d4B3M3sgd3kA8W7 and also open-source the code of the project at https://github.com/agiresearch/MoralBench.\\n        \\u25b3 Less\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
